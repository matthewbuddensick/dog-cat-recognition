# dog-cat-recognition
Classification of dogs/cat images using tensorflow and keras to create and train a convolutional neural network using a GPU to decrease training time.

The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog) and includes pictures of dogs and cats. Used image augmentation such as randomly flipping and rotating photos to increase the size of the training data and improve the performance of the model and its ability to generalize to other data. Achieved accuracy of about 95% on unseen testing data.
